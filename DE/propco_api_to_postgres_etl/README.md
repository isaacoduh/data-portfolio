## Project: Real Estate Data Evolution: Streamlining Property Records Management with an Efficient PostgresSQL ETL Pipeline for Propco

This project was designed to streamline the management of property records for the Propco Real Estate Agency by developing an efficient ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline using a PostgreSQL database. The goal was to enhance data accuracy and accessibility, which are crucial for optimizing real estate transactions and decision-making processes. By integrating PostgreSQL, known for its robustness and reliability, the ETL pipeline facilitated a seamless flow and integration of data from multiple sources, ensuring that property records were consistently up-to-date and easily queryable.

    "1. What is a generator function\n",
    " - a function that returns a lazy iterator\n",
    " - A generator function in Python is a special kind of function that returns a lazy iterator. These iterators allow you to loop over the items they generate without storing all items in memory at the same time.\n",
    " -Introduced with PEP 255, generator functions are a powerful feature for creating iterators that you can work with in a memory-efficient way.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. What’s a key difference between a list and a generator?\n",
    "    - Generators do not store their contents in memory\n",
    "    - A key difference between a list and a generator in Python is that generators don’t store their contents in memory, while lists do. This makes generators lazy iterators, meaning they generate their elements on the fly, as you request them, instead of storing them all upfront.\n",
    "    - This can be a big advantage when you’re working with large datasets or when you’re generating a sequence of results that you only need to process one at a time.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. What is the difference between yield and return in a Python function?\n",
    "    - yield sends a value back to the caller and remembers the statre of the funciton for the next call, while return sends a value back and exits the function.\n",
    "    - You can use the yield keyword in a function like a return statement.\n",
    "    - However, yield returns a value and pauses the function’s execution while keeping the function’s state. You can resume the function with the next call right where it left off, which allows the function to generate a series of values over time instead of computing all values at once.\n",
    "    - This is why functions that contain a yield statement are called generators.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. The yield statement in a generator function suspends the function execution and returns the yielded value to the caller.\n",
    "    - You can then resume the function from the same point the next time you’re calling one of the generator’s methods. This is different from return, which finishes function execution completely.\n",
    "    - Once you’ve fully iterated over a generator, it raises a StopIteration exception to signal that it’s exhausted.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. What is the main difference between generator expression and list comprehension in python?\n",
    "    - a generator expression does not build and hold the entire data in memory before iteration. During iteration, the generator only generates one item at a time.\n",
    "    - This means that you won’t have a memory penalty when you use generator expressions.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. What does .send() do in the context of a Python generator?\n",
    "    - In the context of a Python generator, you can use .send() to send a value back to the generator.\n",
    "    - When you use yield as an expression, then you can use .send() to manipulate the yielded value. This allows you to update the state of the generator from outside the generator function.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. What does .throw() do in a python generator?\n",
    "    - The .throw() method allows you to throw exceptions within a Python generator.\n",
    "    - For example, you can use .throw() to control when you stop iterating through the generator.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. In Python, you can stop a generator by calling its .close() method. This method raises a StopIteration exception, which you can use to signal the end of a finite iterator.\n",
    "9. What happens when you iterate over a generator fully?\n",
    "    - When you fully iterate over a generator, then it exhausts itself.\n",
    "    - This means that you can’t iterate over the same generator again. If you try to do so, the generator won’t yield any more values."
